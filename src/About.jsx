          Hi! I am a <span className="text-blue-400">web developer</span> based in <span className="text-blue-400">Nairobi, Kenya</span>, with a strong passion for creating <span className="text-blue-400">web applications</span>. I hold a <span className="text-blue-400">BSc in Business Information Technology</span> from <span className="text-blue-400">Mount Kenya University</span>, where I honed my skills in software development and technology management.

        <p>
          Throughout my educational journey, I have not only focused on academics but also actively worked on personal projects and collaborated with clients to develop custom <span className="text-blue-400">web solutions</span>. These experiences have given me hands-on expertise in <span className="text-blue-400">front-end and back-end development</span>, as well as a deep understanding of <span className="text-blue-400">user experience</span> and <span className="text-blue-400">design principles</span>.
        </p>
        <br className="my-3" />
        <p>
          In addition to my development work, I have cultivated a presence on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@eclarkhalid/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-900 underline">YouTube</a>, where I share my knowledge and teach <span className="text-blue-400">programming</span> to a growing audience.
